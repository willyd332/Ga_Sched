# BIG PICTURE: What languages are we learning and why? 

### A look at the big things taught by GA's WDI

## JavaScript

  This is the only language that runs in a Brower. It's Object Oriented, but a bit weird. It also can run in Node, and be used for backend applications. 
 
## JavaScript + Node

  This allows us to build back end applications that talk to databases using JavaScript. Why? It's fast, it's popular, and it's nice to be able to build a full stack app in one language. 
  
## Bash

  This is the language of our machine. It's what your OS uses behind the scenes to open a file when you double click it. You can use it to interact with your machine via the terminal. It is very practical, but it is also a very powerful programming language in its own right! We use it to navigate through folders with `cd`, create things with `mkdir` and `touch`, interact with `git`, `npm` and other tools, and more. It can also be used for automating tasks on your machine, making web requests with `curl` and much more!
  
## HTML

This is not a programming language, but a templating language for creating the structure of web pages

## CSS

Also not a programming language, but a domain specific declarative language. Meaning it is for the specific domain of styling web pages, and it is used to declare things like "This should be red!"

## jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript library for DOM manipulation. 

## React JS

React is a hugely popular, powerful, cool way to create SPA's. It is a JavaScript *framework*, which means it's a library that not only gives you helper methods like jQuery does, but it also gives you specific ways to structure your application. 

## Second Language 


1.  **Python, (Flask - Server Framework)** - **Jim** Globally 
 * Very popular
 * Easy to get up and running fast
 * Python skills are used all over the place, especially in the emerging fields of Data Science and AI.
